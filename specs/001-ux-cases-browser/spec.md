# Feature Specification: UX Cases Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-ux-cases-browser`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ok, now let's build an application, that users can get some cases from this website. The cases are about User Experience. Users can navigate each case thru sidebar. There is Do and Don't toggle button so user's can toggle cases."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse UX Cases (Priority: P1)

A user visits the website to learn about UX best practices by browsing through different UX cases. They can see a list of available cases in a sidebar and click on any case to view its content.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without being able to browse and view cases, the application has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the homepage and verifying that cases are displayed in the sidebar and can be clicked to view content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they see the sidebar, **Then** they can see a list of available UX cases
2. **Given** a user sees a case in the sidebar, **When** they click on it, **Then** the case content is displayed in the main area
3. **Given** a user is viewing a case, **When** they click on a different case in the sidebar, **Then** the content updates to show the new case

### User Story 2 - Toggle Do/Don't Examples (Priority: P1)

A user viewing a UX case can toggle between "Do" and "Don't" examples to see both good and bad practices for the same UX principle.

**Why this priority**: The Do/Don't toggle is a core differentiator that provides educational value by showing contrasting examples.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing any case and verifying that the toggle button switches between Do and Don't examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing a UX case, **When** they see the Do/Don't toggle, **Then** they can click it to switch between examples
2. **Given** a user is viewing the "Do" example, **When** they click the toggle, **Then** the content changes to show the "Don't" example
3. **Given** a user is viewing the "Don't" example, **When** they click the toggle, **Then** the content changes to show the "Do" example

### User Story 3 - Navigate Between Cases (Priority: P2)

A user can easily navigate between different UX cases to learn about various UX principles and best practices.

**Why this priority**: Navigation between cases enables users to explore multiple topics and get comprehensive UX education.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking through multiple cases in the sidebar and verifying smooth transitions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing one case, **When** they click on another case in the sidebar, **Then** the content updates without page reload
2. **Given** a user navigates between cases, **When** they return to a previously viewed case, **Then** the case remembers their last Do/Don't toggle state
3. **Given** a user is on a case, **When** they use browser back/forward buttons, **Then** the navigation works as expected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no cases available?
- How does the system handle cases with missing Do or Don't examples?
- What happens when a user tries to access a case that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle slow loading of case content?
